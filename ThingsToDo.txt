Things to add (near future):
 - Event linking and un/locked states. So world events can be present but not active until another event is activated.

Things to change:
 - Make locked events "inert". They have artwork but can't be activated.
 - Make enter events require an enter press, and others require stepping on.
 - Make map->events->player be blitted to screen based on z. (eg. map[0]->events[0]->player[0]->map[1]). This way map elements can be over player. This means checking for "blocked" around the player will require checking on his own z level. Also, it's important to note player's z is a list, so that while transitioning from say 1 to 2, he is both 1 and 2, but as soon as he's on a tile that's purely 1 or 2 he changes to that. (i guess this means tiles can have lists of zs... that needs changing)
 - Make tiles just floating rects that collide with the view to be printed (in ascending z order)

Known bugs:
 - It's possible to step onto an event that chains to another event that appears partly under you. If this new event is blocked, you can't move. Maybe not a problem, you just shouldn't be able to make chains that make blocked events under or around the previous event (since even if it's not under you it could be under one of your 4 corners).

Things to consider:
 - There can't be pathways over ground you can walk on since the map is flat. -ADDRESSING WITH "Z"







Things to know about WorldEvents:
 - If one_time is 0, blocked must be 1
 - If blocked is 1, enter must be 1
 - art and art_tile must be surrounded by quotes so that if it's empty it's invisible (if one's empty, so must be the other)
 - a blocked event can't chain to an unblocked event that's only one tile away
