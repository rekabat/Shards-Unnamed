Things to add (near future):
 - Event linking (not added) and un/locked states (added). So world events can be present but not active until another event is activated.

Things to change:
 - Make map->events->player be blitted to screen based on z. (eg. map[0]->events[0]->player[0]->map[1]). This way map elements can be over player. This means checking for "blocked" around the player will require checking on his own z level. Also, it's important to note player's z is a list, so that while transitioning from say 1 to 2, he is both 1 and 2, but as soon as he's on a tile that's purely 1 or 2 he changes to that. (i guess this means tiles can have lists of zs... that needs changing - CHANGED)
 - Don't remove events if one_time is false.
 - Make tiles just floating rects that collide with the view to be printed (in ascending z order)

Known bugs:
 - It's possible to step onto an event that chains to another event that appears partly under you. If this new event is blocked, you can't move. Maybe not a problem, you just shouldn't be able to make chains that make blocked events under or around the previous event (since even if it's not under you it could be under one of your 4 corners).
 - all the map below the player gets drawn, then all the events, then the player, then all the map above the player, then all the events above the player. This means that if player is on 2, an event is on 3, but z 4 map is supposed to be above it, the z3 event will be drawn on top of the z4 maptile. But that's a pretty complex map...

Things to consider:
 - There can't be pathways over ground you can walk on since the map is flat. -ADDRESSING WITH "Z"







Things to know about WorldEvents:
 - If one_time is 0, blocked must be 1
 - If blocked is 1, enter must be 1
 - art and art_tile must be surrounded by quotes so that if it's empty it's invisible (if one's empty, so must be the other)
 - a blocked event can't chain to an unblocked event that's only one tile away
