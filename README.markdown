#Shattered (Working Name)
##The Game:
###Overview:
Intended to be an RPG with a free-roaming, 2D environment.

The concept is you have "focuses". These let you channel the energy of four different types of shards, using them up in the process. This allows you to unleash magical attacks to take down foes. The story, in development, is one dealing with the gods. You are a minor god who destroyed a god from a higher pantheon. For this you are banished. The story is your attempt to reascend to heaven. Meanwhile, on Earth, your godly strength dwindles so you need to learn more magic to compensate.

Featuring:
- A.I. – A* pathfinding and responsive animated combat
- Multiprocessing – asynchronous calls to pathfinding
